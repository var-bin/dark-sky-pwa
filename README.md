# My First Progressive Web App

[Your First Progressive Web App][codelab] codelab.

I built a weather web app using Progressive Web App
techniques and Dark Sky API. My app:

* Uses responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
* Is fast & reliable, using a service worker to precache the app resources
  (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run, and cache the weather data
  at runtime to improve performance.
* Can be installable, using a web app manifest and the `beforeinstallprompt` event
  to notify the user it's installable.


## What I've learnt

* How to create and add a web app manifest
* How to provide a simple offline experience
* How to provide a full offline experience
* How to make my app installable
